***Note: you need some kind of mod that allow uses kilohemp item as drug. (harvest drugs mods etc).

Since i do not use road blocks for anything... i just change it by weed plants.. so if u wanna do the same: 

1-Replace your spawn_roadblock.sqf with the one provided here location : dayz_server.pbo\compile\

2-open your init.sqf find this line to manage the amount of fiber plants spawned.
```ruby
MaxDynamicDebris = 20; 
```
